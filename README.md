MyWebsite
=========

Hello, this is Atsuhiro Sean Suzuki.

This is my first website I created using the school server since it was offered for free.
I worked on this while looking at other people's websites and going through website tutorials. 

This website is still simple. I wanted to add a commenting feature to this, but learned that I need to use php for it.

It is also lacking comments which I should have done while coding but I completely forgot on this one.
